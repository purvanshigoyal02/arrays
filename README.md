Introduction
Arrays are fundamental data structures in computer science, providing a way to store and manipulate a collection of elements. This repository aims to cover all the necessary array operations required for DSA, from basic to advanced levels.

Array Types and Operations:

1D Array-
A one-dimensional array is a simple linear structure. The basic operations covered include:
•	Initialization
•	Accessing elements
•	Traversal
•	Modification

2D Array-
Two-dimensional arrays are used for matrix-like data structures. The operations covered include:
•	Initialization
•	Accessing elements
•	Traversal
•	Modification

Duplicacy in Arrays-
Handling duplicates in arrays is crucial for many applications. This section includes:
•	Identifying duplicates
•	Removing duplicates

Linear Search-
Linear search is a straightforward searching technique. The operations include:
•	Searching for an element in an array
•	Analyzing time complexity

Binary Search-
Binary search is an efficient searching technique for sorted arrays. The operations include:
•	Implementing binary search
•	Analyzing time complexity

Merging Arrays-
Merging arrays is a common operation, especially in sorting algorithms. The operations include:
•	Merging two sorted arrays
•	Handling duplicates during merging

Inserting and Deleting Elements-
Inserting and deleting elements are fundamental operations in array manipulation. The operations include:
•	Inserting elements at a specific position
•	Deleting elements from a specific position

Finding Missing Elements-
Finding missing elements in arrays is a common problem. This section includes:
•	Finding missing elements using a normal approach
•	Finding missing elements using hashing

Increasing and Decreasing Array Size-
Managing the size of arrays dynamically is essential for efficient memory usage. This section includes:
•	Increasing the size of an array
•	Decreasing the size of an array

Dynamic Array-
Dynamic arrays offer flexibility by automatically resizing. The operations include:
•	Implementing a dynamic array
•	Understanding the underlying mechanisms

Getting Started
To get started with this repository, clone it to your local machine using the following command:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd Array-DSA
You can then navigate to the relevant directories and compile the C or C++ files using your preferred compiler.

Usage
Each directory contains C and C++ source files with well-commented code. To compile and run the examples, use the following commands:

For C files:

bash
Copy code
gcc filename.c -o output
./output
For C++ files:

bash
Copy code
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
Feel free to explore and modify the code to understand the underlying concepts better.
